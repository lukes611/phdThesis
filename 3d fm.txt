paper title: Multi-scale Features for Approximate Alignment of
Point-based Surfaces


can use scale space similar to 2d versions [wit83,lin94, low04]

multi-scale analysis of surface curvature distribution for 3d face recognition

[gwm01] extracts features from point clouds

they want to compute and describe features which are stable for use in registration rather than visually salient

[yf02] - uses a set of high curvature points at features

[wg02] - uses bitangent points

variety of surface descriptors used [jh97, yf02, wg02, fkh*04, sm92, slw02]

features based on spin images and 3d shape contexts are robust to outliers and handle noise well

their apporach uses local signatures related to the normal frield near the surface and are approximately invariant to rigid transformations

multi-scale surface features:
builds scale space representation and uses the locations of level difference extrema as the salient feature points (similar to finding the extrema of the scale-normalized laplacian of gaussian in the 2d case [Low04]).

compute point clouds at different scales using technique paper describes

salient features are described by their: minima and maxima of normal differences
