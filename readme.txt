Final Todo:
	Reviewer #1
		overall:
			improve future work section
			yes/no research questions are weird: use the paper 
				check how the researchers from ch2 response did it
		
		lit rev:
			support the readability more
			clear sign posting for the reader towards specific research questions
				revisit these questions in each chapter to guide the reader on a journey
			step back from algorithm specifics and look at the significance of a particular point
			improve flow
			say how i did the lit review: database used and search terms
			say how the research questions relate at the beginning and end of each chapter
		
		metho:
			explain the choice of quantitative and qualitative methodology choices
			say what is being measured:
				efficiency
				implementation efficiency
				characteristics
				error rates
			move the efficiency tests to the methodology section?
				ground them in computer science theory
			explain the choice of 3d model selection
			explain that it is me whom is making the qualitative analysis to the compression results
			qualitative methods too subjective? - for compression of models
		
		complete:
			additions to arguments
			review of literature
			interpretations to findings
			and typographical error fixing
		
		
		general:
			chapter instructions need to be grounded in the research questions
			give each chapter an overview with respect to the previous chapter
			clearer chapter summaries with signposting the next chapter with respect
			separate equations from running text more and list the equations in a table
			remove running titles with no content
		Abstract:
			write about contributions before algorithm specifics
			tell the quantitative and qualitative reasonings
			
		intro:
			ground the thesis in a clear stmt of contribution: see example
			number the research questions and separate them from the text
			try not to use yes/no questions

			separate "research aims and contributions" into:
				1. research aims
				2. research contributions
				3. publications resulting from thesis
				
			change the wording of s1.3 "Overview" to "Thesis structure"
				+ add additional summary of the chapter
				
			add a chapter summary of 2-3 paragraphs to explain the major points and signposting
				for the rest of the thesis
				
		lit rev:
			add a chapter intro
				add brief stmt of each sub paragraph
			state which databases and search terms i used to generate the lit review
			define:
				fast/faster/robust/accurate/popular/efficient within the problem domain
			add a summary or table for each of the algorithms
			ground the lit review in terms of a problem a bit more
			text and images are different alignments: fix this
			Sensors, Stereo Cameras, Monocular Approaches need to have sub section numbers
			check spelling page 23. seed -> see
			
		methodology:
			summarise the research questions
			explain the rationale in relation to comp sci theory
			why is complexity used to measure efficiency
			explain how methods scale in efficiency with scene complexity
			why were specific 3d models used in qualitative analysis
			who did the qualitative assessments and does this introduce bias
			
		Experiments:
			re-state the research questions/problems in the intro
			explain the choice of tool selection: convenience or fit for purpose
			hand in the github integration of the code base
			increase image sizes or add into appendices
			presented tables for reconstruction error should be ordered by results
			image 4.13 is not commented correctly (left / right ) is not presented
			say rationale behind data visulisation methods
			4.16,4.17,4.18 are too small and not commented right
			include a chapter summary and clearly relate it to the research questions
			
		Conclusions:
			link results back to questions
			cross reference to lit review reverts to experiments section (check this)
			separate sections on research SWOT linking back the the lit-rev and methodology
			the research aims revisited is too weak just saying yes and yes
			the future works section should be much larger explaining what could be done in
				a swot way for post doctorial work

			only 11 out of 194 references are from past 4 years
			
			
	Reviewer #2:
		section 3.1 does not explain enough for the non-technical reader
		refer to why using fft and lpt are unique in the research context
		fix citation method??
		references in alphabetical order
		page 3. line 14: insert space after occurs
		page 6 line 4: FVR 4.5, what does 4.5 stand for?
		chapter 4: figures 20 and 21: are out of sequence
		chapter 3 is not cover it enough
		should have more critical interpretation in the lit review
		sec 3.1 says fft is new; make this more clear
		references should be of format: page numbers, dashed page numbers, year of pub, page range
			and the publisher
		
	Chairman:
		signpostign and summaries on conclusions and intros (revert to research questiond)
		explain my use of research question
		improve: flow,readability, and presentation and the methods of getting the lit rev papers
		explain the quantit and quali research methodologies better
		improve flow
		explain things for laymen better
		chapter 3 should explain 3d recon better, note what are the roles image registration plays in 3d recon
		why is 3d fft new? lp too?
		citations should include page numbers
