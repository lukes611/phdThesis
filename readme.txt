	Medium Changes:
		1. Try the new CUDA framework, test the speed of FVR and compare it to the others
		2. Add a theoretical performance graph to compare FVR and ICP
		3. Redo the labels for the Monocular camera results tables.
		4. Add the figure comparing ICP, FM2D and FVR qualitatively
		
	Ask Clare:
		1. Inquire about what was meant by "Highlight big picture" on Page 20
		2. Page 79. "while -" why the dash
		3. what do you mean on page 101 / (105 in ms word (fig 3.7))
		
	Replace:
		
		4. projection-map transform -> "Projection-map transform"
		6. octree -> ?
		9. x-axis (my data structure names) -> ?
		3. phase correlation -> phase correlation
		10. capitals in table headers = check AMA
		
		
	Other Major:
		1. fix tables
			cannot find reference to figure 3.2 and 3.8
			change all my active data set names from X Axis set ... to X-Axis set
			
		
	Submission Preparation:
		1. Research PhD Submission on Griffith Site
		1. Email Goul, Ask him about the form to be filled, and the process
		2. Remind Ruben to fill out such a form
		3. Inquire to HDR office about print-out and submission [if 1. fails]
