	1. Changes:
		a. discuss qualitative results as vs. the competitors
			1. measure plane-tree in bytes and bpv
				draw output [done]: camera angle: Fps_cam(R3(86.078979,390.000000,678.281860), 290.000000, 108.000000);
				compute bits, bytes, bpv [done]
			2. get some pictures from my bio-tree paper
			3. compare
			4. put pictures in thesis
			5.
