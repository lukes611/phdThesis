	notes:
		2 - now I only mentioned I reference any previous work
		9 - it is a new algorithm compared to the honours though
		24. There is no run time comparison to verify your theoretical complexity in sect 3.1.4. Why not?
			 - since i have a theoretical one can I skip it?
		25. In sect 4.8 - 4.12 you should only present results that are novel and compare them against those in your honours thesis. - these are novel from my adelaide paper

	TODO
		22. Figure 4.27 shows reconstructions for FVR but none for ICP and FM you state that they are difficult to reconstruct with these, but a picture is worth 1000 words the worse they look the better it is for you. If you really can not reconstruct these then please given specific and detailed justification of why they are difficult to reconstruct.

	CLARE-TODO
		page 20. highlight big picture? ask clare about this
		replace color with colour throughout
		page 79 "while -"?
		check all figures come after mentioned
		cannot find reference to figure 3.2
		make sure asus xtion is stable
		make figure 3.4A: A Projected Frame (a bit larger)
		check listing 3.3 after
		check capitalization for Phase Correlation vs phase correlation
		ask clare about what she means on page 101 / 105 in ms word (fig 3.7)
		figure 3.8 is not reffered to in text
		tables should have their titles/captions above the table
		projection map transform - this algorithm name should be capitalised???
		make sure fm3d is FM-3D everywhere
		in 3DReconstruction.tex:line-207 listing labeled:"Phase Correlation Based SLAM Algorithm" is not referenced in text
		check all Octree is uppercase O
		ask ruben about para 3 in intro in experiments section subsection 4.1
		in tools remove anything about microsoft cam
		fix all table / figure numbers see figure 4.2 / 4.1
		find all dataset and Data Set to "data set"
		do all fm3d to FM-3D
		change all my active data set names from X Axis set ... to X-Axis set

	ask ruben:
		questions from above
		what i need to do to be ready to submit
		do i need to print it?
		what formatting do i need
		what referencing do i need
