	notes:
		2 - now I only mentioned I reference any previous work
		9 - it is a new algorithm compared to the honours though
		24. There is no run time comparison to verify your theoretical complexity in sect 3.1.4. Why not?
			 - since i have a theoretical one can I skip it?
		25. In sect 4.8 - 4.12 you should only present results that are novel and compare them against those in your honours thesis. - these are novel from my adelaide paper

	TODO
		22. Figure 4.27 shows reconstructions for FVR but none for ICP and FM you state that they are difficult to reconstruct with these, but a picture is worth 1000 words the worse they look the better it is for you. If you really can not reconstruct these then please given specific and detailed justification of why they are difficult to reconstruct.

	CLARE-TODO
		page 20. highlight big picture? ask clare about this
		replace color with colour throughout
		page 79 "while -"?
		check all figures come after mentioned
		cannot find reference to figure 3.2
