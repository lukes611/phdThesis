		2 - now I only mentioned I reference any previous work

Sect 1.2 Contributions
	notes:
		9 - it is a new algorithm compared to the honours though

Chapter 4
	notes:
		24. There is no run time comparison to verify your theoretical complexity in sect 3.1.4. Why not?
			 - since i have a theoretical one can I skip it?

		
Chapter 3 
	TODO
		13. Section 3.2 needs to mention my honours thesis
		

Chapter 4 
	TODO
		18. In sec 4.4.5 there are not a lot of no comparative results it would be nicer to have something more.

		21. You should make some comment in section 4.5 and 4.6 that since you are using the active camera data source that don't give the best results that it affects the performance margin of FVR compared to the FM and ICP methods

		22. Figure 4.27 shows reconstructions for FVR but none for ICP and FM you state that they are difficult to reconstruct with these, but a picture is worth 1000 words the worse they look the better it is for you. If you really can not reconstruct these then please given specific and detailed justification of why they are difficult to reconstruct.

		25. In sect 4.8 - 4.12 you should only present results that are novel and compare them against those in your honours thesis.
