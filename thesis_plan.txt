	1: Introduction
		1.1: Background
			1.1.1 3D Reconstruction 
            1.1.2 Compression
			1.1.3 how these fit in
		1.2: Problem:
			1.2.1: Issues (add: different types of features to match)
				3D Reconstruction and other areas depend on Feature Matching
				issues:
					fails if not enough features
					feature confusion
                    large baselines
					time depends on number of features
                    can not handle large amounts of noise
                    object motion becomes a problem
					limited use in outdoor and complex environments
                    camera is not perfect for generating depth data
			1.2.2: 
				storage issue
		1.3 Hypothesis:
			1.3.1 PC can improve Reconstruction
				overcome feature matching issues
				reduce complexity
				improve accuracy
				increase the environments in which can be used
			1.3.2:
				Improving Data Representation
					reduces complexity
					
		1.4 Constraints:
			Scope of research:
				what to look at and why?
