In order to test different registration methods. Algorithms were written in C/C++ using both Visual Studio (2012 and 2015) on a Windows (7 \& 10) machine and code-blocks 16 on an Ubuntu machine. All source code is made available online at: https://github.com/lukes611/phdThesis. In order to measure registration algorithms we use the error metrics described in the \ref{metricsSection} section.
