In order to evaluate the accuracy of volume registration we use several error metrics including: Hausdorff error, mean squared error and the percentage of matched voxels. We describe mathematically those techniques here. All measurements are based on a simple function which computes the nearest neighbour for a given 3D point or voxel given a volume (or collection of 3D points). We define such a function, named nearest-neighbour in equation \ref{eqn:NN}.

\begin{equation} \label{eqn:NN}
NN(p, V) =  \{ q \in V | (Dist(q, p) < Dist(k, p))  \forall k \in V \}
\end{equation}

This function retrieves the closest corresponding point given a query point $p$ and a volume or point cloud of points, $V$. This function can be used to provide omni-directional error functions based on Hausdorff, mean squared and percentage accuracy error metrics.

Here some one-way error functions are described. The one was Hausdorff error is defined in \ref{eqn:HDOW} 

\begin{equation} \label{eqn:HDOW}
\sum_{k=0}^{N} Dist(P_k, NN(P_k, Q))
\end{equation}
