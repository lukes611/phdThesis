Several experiments were designed in order to evaluate both the FVR method as well as the Plane-Tree and 3D Shade-Tree method. The types of these experiments as well as their conditions and results are presented in this section. In the next section (section \ref{TestDataSection}) the test data used in experimentation is introduced. Following that (in section \ref{ToolsSection}), the tools used to run these experiments are also introduced along with various error metrics (section \ref{metricsSection}) which provide means for comparisons between algorithms. \\

Then different results for experiments analysing the performance of FVR and comparing it to methods used in the current literature are presented. These experiments compare the FVR's ability to track camera movements (sections \ref{Sec:CamTransTrackExp} and \ref{Sec:CamRoteTrackExp}), its qualitative performance (section \ref{Sec:FVRQual1Exp}) and its robustness to noise (section \ref{Sec:FVRMotionExp}). Experiments evaluating the performance of Monocular FVR are then presented in section \ref{Sec:MonocularExperimentsSection} followed by experiments comparing FVR-3D to commonly used procedures from the literature. After these experiments, the Plane-Tree is compared to the Octree. These experiments compare both method's efficacy in compressing 3D mesh data. The Plane-Tree is also compared to various state-of-the-art compression techniques from the literature. Next, qualitative compression results are presented comparing the Plane-Tree to several other methods. Finally, the Plane-Tree is compared to both the Octree and the 3D-ShadeTree in compressing 3D reconstructions. \\
