In figure \ref{fig:FIGS} we present qualitative results for the Plane-Tree. The third row shows the bunny, rabbit and horse models along with the number of bytes and bpv required to store them uncompressed. The first row shows each model compressed by the Plane-Tree with a threshold of 8.0. Despite these being crude approximations of the originals, the models are still distinguishable with around 1000 $\times$ less storage space required. \\

In the second row, each model was compressed with the Plane-Tree at a threshold of 1.0. In these experiments there is little detail missing compared with the physical model. When looking at the bunny's legs, the same ripples are present. In the rabbit model, the outlines inside the ears and on the eyes are still present. On the horse model, the creases on the body and shoulder of the horse are still present. Here, the bunny is compressed to around 70 $\times$ less storage space, the rabbit at around 265 $\times$ less and the horse around 90 $\times$ less storage space. \\
