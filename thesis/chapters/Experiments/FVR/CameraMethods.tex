Experiments show that the FVR based techniques are capable of registration across the three primary types of sensors used in 3D reconstruction and SLAM research. These sensors include: Stereo sensors, which are capable of generating dense depth data with the highest accuracy and resolution, active cameras which are efficient hardware based solutions to depth generation and monocular cameras, which produce the least accurate and most noisy depth maps. As mentioned in the literature review these sensor types have associated advantages and disadvantages. \\

In section \ref{StereoSOTA}, results testing the stereo Kitti dataset are presented. These show that FVR based methods are
