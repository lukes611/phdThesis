sdf[7 \cite{Curless96Volumetric}]

Canelhas [6 \cite{Canelhas12Scene}] did masters thesis an approach for camera tracking, similar to this
his focus concentrates on object detection and recognition in an sdf and no thorough evaluation was performed

Kubacki [14 \cite{Kubacki12Registration}] showed how an sdf can be used to estimate camera pose, only on synthetic data without a comparative evaluation
[19 \cite{Ren12Unified}] demonstrated sdf based object tracking, based on known models

Dense 3D scene representations:
occupancy mapping : use a grid to store data
[9 \cite{Elfes87Sensor}] uses a Bayesian probability of occupancy to measure whether should be added to the grid
also can used signed distance functions [9 \cite{Elfes87Sensor}] (SDF), it can be used to fuse partial depth scans, whilst mitigating
issues relating mesh-based reconstruction algorithms
SDF represents : surface interfaces as 0, positive values that increase with distance from the nearest surface
and occupied space using a negative value
more robust to noise version of SDF -> [30 \cite{Zach07Globally} ]
SDF can be visualized by first converting to mesh and rendering ( use marching cubes [18 \cite{Cubes87High}]) or it can be directly ray cast [21 \cite{Parker98Interactive}]
[23 \cite{Rusinkiewicz02Real}] used frame-by-frame ICP with occupancy grid, users can scan in small objects by rotating the objects with their hand
works @ 10hz, issue: does not do global optimization, cannot do large scenes . final models are optimized using [7 \cite{Curless96Volumetric}]
sdf fusion in real time may be possible
sdf can be used for globally satisfying reconstruction
small scale reconstructions:
	[28 \cite{Weise09Hand}] -> produces high quality scans using a fixed ToF sensor
	[6 \cite{Cui103d} ] demonstrate a moving handheld ToF scanner
