SLAM used in robotics [30 \cite{Thrun02Robotic},22 \cite{Nuchter056d},10 \cite{Grisetti07Efficient}, 6 \cite{Dellaert06Square},15 \cite{Kaess08Isam},9 \cite{Frese05Multilevel},23 \cite{Olson06Fast}]


vslam [5 \cite{Davison03Real} , 16 \cite{Klein07Parallel}, 28 \cite{Strasdat10Real}, 14 \cite{Jin00Real}, 21 \cite{Nister05Preemptive}] => get sparse keypoints,  
these simplify data association

\cite{Stuhmer10Real} - dense 3D mapping which is improved from multiple image integration, competes with newcombe10, but uses a variational method where depth maps are computed on the GPU and the scene is considered static as camera pose is computed independently on the cpu
