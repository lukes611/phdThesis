\section{Summary}

As is evident from the current literature that SLAM and 3D reconstruction have a focus on feature matching and RANSAC or ICP. However, these approaches fail when there are too few features, when feature confusion occurs or, when features are non-stationary due to object motion. As the extent of random feature displacement becomes more global the effectiveness of these approaches diminishes. Feature matching also dominates in image registration. Some more current methods are based on optimization over an SDF \cite{Bylow13Real,Rusinkiewicz02Real}. These methods promise more accurate results since they find accurate poses using the entire data. In 2D image processing, Fourier based methods have also been shown to register large rotations and scales using all of the input data \cite{Gonzalez11Improving}. Fourier approaches are also closed form solutions, insensitive to noise (object motion) and scale easily to GPU based algorithms. Accordingly, in this thesis, we propose a novel, closed form Fourier based 3D reconstruction method. \\
