In order to answer the research questions about the impact of Fourier based 3D reconstruction techniques and hierarchical 3D data compression, the context for the area of 3D data processing, 3D reconstruction and registration techniques must be explored by the reader. By providing context for these areas, the algorithms proposed in chapter \ref{ch:Metho} Methodology can be evaluated (chapter \ref{ch:Experiments}). \\

At the beginning of this chapter, a background into registration, depth data generation and 3D data representation is provided followed by an in-depth survey of 3D reconstruction procedures. The initial background in section \ref{Sec:LitRevBackgroundX} details several important areas in 3D reconstruction, 3D registration and 3D data generation and representation. Section \ref{Sec:LitRevBackgroundX} starts with subsection \ref{sec:LitRevFeatureMatching11} which contains a review of feature matching methods. Feature matching methods are the first-step for several registration techniques which make up 3D reconstruction algorithms. Subsection \ref{Sec:SuperficialPCSection} describes the phase correlation method, a Fourier based technique for data registration. Subsection \ref{Sec:SuperficialPCSection} provides context for several of the algorithms proposed in chapter \ref{ch:Metho}. Subsection \ref{DepthDataGenSection} describes depth data generation using various sensors and software techniques. This data is the input to 3D reconstruction techniques, therefore a solid understanding of depth data generation is important for contemplating the algorithms described in section \ref{sec:LitRevReconstructionTechniques} and the novel methods proposed in chapter \ref{ch:Metho}. Subsection \ref{sec:LitRevDataRepresentation} reviews 3D data representations. These are compared to the proposed Plane-Tree representation technique in section \ref{sec:PlaneTreeMetho18}. \\

Later in this chapter, section \ref{sec:LitRevReconstructionTechniques} surveys several current techniques for 3D reconstruction and registration. These techniques are compared to the proposed Fourier based techniques in the chapter \ref{ch:Experiments} Experiments. The techniques covered include: the Fundamental matrix method, Feature matching with RANSAC, ICP, Direct optimization, 3D feature matching, PCA and other optimization techniques. \\
