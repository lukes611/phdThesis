\subsection{Depth Sensor Based Reconstruction}

In this section we describe the process of projecting, registering and integrating 3D reconstructions from depth sensor based input. Depth Sensor based input is fast and reliable but such date not only requires specialized hardware, it also has several draw-backs discussed here.
