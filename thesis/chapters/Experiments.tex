plane tree is compared with sota mesh compression - proven by my paper published and in terms of compressing 3d reconstructions we compare it to the common OT representation. \\

Experiments reveal the Plane-Tree outperforms the original octree and outperforms some state of the art transform methods at low-bitrates. We compare our method with several state of the art algorithms which correspond to transform based methods \cite{Khodakovsky00Progressive,Bayazit103DMesh} and low-bitrate codecs \cite{Peng10Feature}. To compare algorithms quantitatively, we employ rate distortion graphs. Since our algorithm is lossy, this indicates the amount of distortion (in the decoded model compared with the original) given a particular bitrate. To measure distortion, we employ the mean error and root mean squared error, to measure bitrate we use the number of bits per vertex. All measurements are scaled by the main diagonal of the input model. We also provide qualitative results showing the effectiveness of our method. \\

In experiments we use 4 models which are popular amongst researchers in the area. These models are chosen both because they are readily available and because there are available results for these models generated by other state of the art methods. Figure \ref{fig:MODSUSED} shows each model along with its reference name and number of vertices. \\
