Here we present a look-up table to assess the various abilities of each 3D reconstruction algorithm in terms or translation, rotation, scale, non-static object motion robustness and ability to handle various sensory types. Table \ref{tab:GridRT} presents these results. In terms of translation, each of the presented algorithms is able to register with respect to translation. In experiments, it was shown that the FVR algorithm outperforms others when this type of camera movement is present. Especially at wider baselines of 10 to 15 centimetres. In Registering rotation, the FVR and FFVR methods are only capable of a single axis of rotation. FVR-3D however, is capable of registering against all 3 axes of rotation. Results have shown that in the presence of rotation, the FVR-3D performs at or above the level of the more accurate algorithms from the literature: ICP and FM-2D. It was found that MVVR was not able to handle rotation well enough, this is due to the high levels of noise found in the depth maps produced by monocular based techniques. \\

In terms of registration against scale, only the FVR and FVR-3D method were capable of registering against it. From the literature, ICP and PCA are not capable of handling such transformations without some modification. Results have shown that these algorithms are capable of handling non-static object motion well. Results on the Kitti Vision benchmark show that FVR-3D outperforms the state of the art, even on data sets which have non-static moving agents. Results also showed that the FVR was the most accurate in the registration of wide baselines, that is translations above 5 centimetres and rotations above 5 degrees. It was show that the FVR algorithm outperformed the others, including the top methods used in the literature. Out of these methods, MVVR was shown to be able to register monocular sensor data against translation when noise levels were low. The closer the depth data computed via monocular methods approaches perfectly accurate depth images, the closer the MVVR algorithm approaches FVR performance. In terms of both stereo and active sensor input, FVR, FFVR and FVR-3D are all capable of handling this type of input data well. \\

In summary, results have shown that on stereo camera results and active camera results, FVR-3D method outperforms outperforms all of the other algorithms from the literature. For most of these data-sets the FVR algorithm was a strong second place contender. When registering wider baselines, the FVR algorithm was the top performer and FVR-3D fell behind.
