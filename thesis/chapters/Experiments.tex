\section{Experiments}

Several experiments were designed in order to evaluate both the FVR method as well as the Plane-Tree and 3D Shade-Tree method. The types of these experiments as well as their conditions and results are presented in this section. In the next section (section \ref{TestDataSection}) the test data used in experimentation is introduced. Following that (in section \ref{ToolsSection}), the tools used to run these experiments are also introduced along with various error metrics (section \ref{metricsSection}) which provide means for comparisons between algorithms. \\

Then different results for experiments analysing the performance of FVR and comparing it to methods used in the current literature are presented. These experiments compare the FVR's ability to track camera movements (sections \ref{Sec:CamTransTrackExp} and \ref{Sec:CamRoteTrackExp}), its qualitative performance (section \ref{Sec:FVRQual1Exp}) and its robustness to noise (section \ref{Sec:FVRMotionExp}). Experiments evaluating the performance of Monocular FVR are then presented in section \ref{Sec:MonocularExperimentsSection} followed by experiments comparing FVR-3D to commonly used procedures from the literature. After these experiments, the Plane-Tree is compared to the Octree. These experiments compare both method's efficacy in compressing 3D mesh data. The Plane-Tree is also compared to various state-of-the-art compression techniques from the literature. Next, qualitative compression results are presented comparing the Plane-Tree to several other methods. Finally, the Plane-Tree is compared to both the Octree and the 3D-ShadeTree in compressing 3D reconstructions. \\

plane tree is compared with sota mesh compression - proven by my paper published and in terms of compressing 3d reconstructions we compare it to the common OT representation. \\

Experiments reveal the Plane-Tree outperforms the original octree and outperforms some state of the art transform methods at low-bitrates. We compare our method with several state of the art algorithms which correspond to transform based methods \cite{Khodakovsky00Progressive,Bayazit103DMesh} and low-bitrate codecs \cite{Peng10Feature}. To compare algorithms quantitatively, we employ rate distortion graphs. Since our algorithm is lossy, this indicates the amount of distortion (in the decoded model compared with the original) given a particular bitrate. To measure distortion, we employ the mean error and root mean squared error, to measure bitrate we use the number of bits per vertex. All measurements are scaled by the main diagonal of the input model. We also provide qualitative results showing the effectiveness of our method. \\

In experiments we use 4 models which are popular amongst researchers in the area. These models are chosen both because they are readily available and because there are available results for these models generated by other state of the art methods. Figure \ref{fig:MODSUSED} shows each model along with its reference name and number of vertices. \\
