\section{Experiments}

Here we explain the experiments performed to analyse and compare the class of FVR methods with 

In this section, various experiment set-ups and test data are discussed. Results are presented in the results section (\ref{ResultsSection}). In this section we first discuss the test data used in section \ref{TestDataSection}, then the tools we used for analysis are discussed (section \ref{ToolsSection}). The algorithms we evaluated and compared are listed in section \ref{AlgorithmsSection}. Finally in the later sections (\ref{QualExperimentsSection} and beyond) we discuss the quantitative and qualitative methods we used to test these algorithms. Finally section \ref{DataRepresentationExperimentsSection} describes the experiments evaluating the proposed Reconstruction data-representation.

\section{Error metrics}

\label{metricsSection}

In order to evaluate the accuracy of volume registration we use several error metrics including: Hausdorff error, mean squared error and the percentage of matched voxels. We describe mathematically those techniques here. All measurements are based on a simple function which computes the nearest neighbour for a given 3D point or voxel given a volume (or collection of 3D points). We define such a function, named nearest-neighbour in equation \ref{eqn:NN}.

\begin{equation} \label{eqn:NN}
NN(p, V) =  \{ q \in V | (Dist(q, p) < Dist(k, p))  \forall k \in V \}
\end{equation}

This function retrieves the closest corresponding point given a query point $p$ and a volume or point cloud of points, $V$. This function can be used to provide omni-directional error functions based on Hausdorff, mean squared and percentage accuracy error metrics.

Here some one-way error functions are described. The one was Hausdorff error is defined in \ref{eqn:HDOW} 

\begin{equation} \label{eqn:HDOW}
\sum_{k=0}^{N} Dist(P_k, NN(P_k, Q))
\end{equation}

plane tree is compared with sota mesh compression - proven by my paper published and in terms of compressing 3d reconstructions we compare it to the common OT representation. \\

Experiments reveal the Plane-Tree outperforms the original octree and outperforms some state of the art transform methods at low-bitrates. We compare our method with several state of the art algorithms which correspond to transform based methods \cite{Khodakovsky00Progressive,Bayazit103DMesh} and low-bitrate codecs \cite{Peng10Feature}. To compare algorithms quantitatively, we employ rate distortion graphs. Since our algorithm is lossy, this indicates the amount of distortion (in the decoded model compared with the original) given a particular bitrate. To measure distortion, we employ the mean error and root mean squared error, to measure bitrate we use the number of bits per vertex. All measurements are scaled by the main diagonal of the input model. We also provide qualitative results showing the effectiveness of our method. \\

In experiments we use 4 models which are popular amongst researchers in the area. These models are chosen both because they are readily available and because there are available results for these models generated by other state of the art methods. Figure \ref{fig:MODSUSED} shows each model along with its reference name and number of vertices. \\
