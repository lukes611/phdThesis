\chapter{Abstract}


Three-Dimensional models are important in a range of industries, including: animation, film, gaming, medical imaging, robotics and engineering. These data require compression to improve processing, transmission and storage efficiency. This thesis presents a new 3D model compression scheme called the Shade-Octree (SOT). The SOT is a hierarchical and lossy codec which makes use of various techniques from hierarchical image compression. Results show that the SOT outperforms the state of the art compression algorithms in terms of rate-distortion (RD) and perceptual quality.
