	sampled models that is specifically apt at dealing with densely sampled
	surface geometry. The compression is lossless and therefore is also
	suitable for storing the unfiltered, raw scan data. Our method is
	based on an octree decomposition of space. The point-cloud is encoded
	in terms of occupied octree-cells. To compress the octree we employ
	novel prediction techniques that were specifically designed for point
	sampled geometry and are based on local surface approximations to
	achieve high compression rates that outperform previous progressive
	coders for point-sampled geometry. Moreover we demonstrate that additional
	point attributes, such as color, which are of great importance for
	point-sampled geometry, can be well integrated and efficiently encoded
	in this framework.},
